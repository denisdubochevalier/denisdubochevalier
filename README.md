## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hello! I'm Denis Chevalier, a Staff Engineer based in France with over 15 years of experience in software development. I specialize in Backend Architecture, Compiler Design and Protocol Implementations. When I'm not pushing code, I'm busy with my music or my latest writing venture.

## ðŸ›  Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Go, Ruby, Javascript, C, C++, Python, Haskell, Lisp, etc. Choosing a language is not a matter of opinion, but of weighting the pros and cons in the context of a project.
- **Technologies:** Relational and non-relational databases, Docker, Git, various cloud platforms, etc.
- **Methodologies:** I am most familiar with Toyota Production System (TPS) Lean, and XP, as well as SRE and DevOps; and lean towards science-based methodologies and practices.
